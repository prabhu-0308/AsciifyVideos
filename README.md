**Asciify : ASCII Art Generator**
===

ASCII(American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a common encoding format used for representing strings and text data in computers.

But..what if we use this for something other than text?

How about images? Images on your terminal!


**Goal**
---
Convert images(jpg/png) to ASCII encoded strings, that look like the image.

Here's an example :
